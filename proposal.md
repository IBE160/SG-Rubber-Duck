## Case Title
AI-driven Project Management Simulation (Construction Project)

## Background
Managing construction projects involves complex decisions related to time, cost, resources, and risk. Students often struggle to grasp how these factors interact in real-world projects. A simulation powered by AI can provide an interactive learning environment where users experience the consequences of their project management choices.

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to simulate the planning and execution of a construction project, allowing users to explore how AI can support project management decisions regarding scheduling, resource allocation, and risk management.

## Target Users
Students and professionals learning project management, particularly within construction, who want to experiment with planning and decision-making in a realistic, data-driven environment.

## Core Functionality

### Must Have (MVP)
- Feature 1: Input project scope, work breakdown structure (WBS), and key parameters such as time, cost, and resource availability
- Feature 2: Generate project timelines (e.g., Gantt charts) using AI-assisted scheduling algorithms
- Feature 3: Simulate project scenarios with varying risks, delays, and resource constraints
- Feature 4: Display updated cost forecasts and performance indicators based on user decisions

### Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)
- Feature 5: Include visualization dashboards for performance metrics (cost, schedule, risk exposure)
- Feature 6: Enable collaboration between multiple users (e.g., project teams)
- Feature 7: Integrate AI-based recommendations for risk mitigation and resource optimization
- Feature 8: Export project reports and simulation logs for further analysis

## Data Requirements
[What information needs to be stored and managed?]
- Data entity 1: Projects – title, scope, start/end date, WBS structure, milestones
- Data entity 2: Resources – type, capacity, cost rate, availability schedule
- Data entity 3: Risks/Events – probability, impact, response strategy
- Data entity 4: Simulation results – planned vs. actual timeline, - cost, risk metrics, recommended actions

## User Stories
[Brief scenarios describing how users will interact with the system]
1. As an instructor, I want to define simulation parameters and constraints so that I can create tailored learning experiences for my students.
2. As a project management student, I want to create a project plan so that I can simulate the effects of different scheduling strategies.
3. As a user, I want to test how risks and resource shortages affect project outcomes so that I can learn to respond effectively.
4. As an instructor, I want to view and compare simulation results from different users so that I can assess decision-making quality.

## Technical Constraints
[Any specific requirements or limitations]
- Must support secure login and project data storage
- Must include AI-based decision support for scheduling and risk evaluation
- Should visualize time and cost data (e.g., Gantt charts, dashboards
- Should be web-based and accessible on desktop devices

## Success Criteria
[How will you know the application is successful?]
- Criterion 1: Users can create and modify project plans and run simulations successfully
- Criterion 2: The system accurately visualizes project timelines, costs, and risks
- Criterion 3: The simulation runs efficiently and supports multiple scenario iterations
